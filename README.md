## Weather Now&Then - A Weather Info App!

I decided to practice my React skills with this Weather API (https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/). Seemed like a good idea to train some hooks and props exchanges.
As I noticed everyone else was doing something really similar to this, I decided to change the layout to look a bit unique and also included the possibility to search for pictures, using the Unsplashed API.

Great practice in terms of API consumption, using components and mastering React hooks as useState and useEffect.
Also got to improve my grid and flex-box layout system!
