## Weather Now&Then - A Weather Info App!

I decided to practice my React skills with this Weather API (https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/). Seemed like a good idea to train some hooks and props exchanges.
As I noticed everyone else was doing something really similar to this, I decided to change the layout to look a bit unique and also included the possibility to search for pictures, using the Unsplashed API.

## Take Aways

Great practice in terms of API consumption, using components and mastering React hooks as useState and useEffect.
Also got to improve my grid and flex-box layout system!

After cloning or downloading the project, use the commands below in the terminal.

```bash
